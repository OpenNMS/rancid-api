RANCID Web Service (RWS)

This is the RWS distribution, which is made up of 3 major parts:

1) RANCID patches

For the RANCID web service to fully work, it was necessary to patch the
control_rancid script that comes as part of RANCID to be able to send
notifications as things are performed within RANCID.  Additionally, an
SNMP MIB was created for the SNMP traps it sends.

These files are available in the contrib/ directory of the binary
distribution, or src/main/filtered/contrib/ in the source distribution.

2) RANCID Web Service CGI

The server-side of the RANCID Web Service integration uses standard
CGI files, along with a simple configuration file.

These files are in the cgi-bin/ directory of the binary distribution,
or src/main/webapp/cgi-bin/ in the source distribution.

3) RANCID Java Client

The client-side of the RANCID Web Service has a reference
implementation written in Java, although the web services themselves
are implemented with a simple RESTful interface that can be accessed
with any REST-capable client, even command-line tools like curl or
wget.

These files are in the src/main/java directory, and can be built
from source using Maven ('mvn install'):
